## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
data("karate")
summary(karate)
```

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
knet <- asNetwork(karate) 
blockmodel(knet,ec = knet %v% "Faction")
kbm <- blockmodel(knet,ec = knet %v% "Faction")$block.model 
g_kar <- sample_sbm(34, pref.matrix = kbm, block.sizes = c(16,18), directed = FALSE)
assortativity(g_kar, c(rep(1,16), rep(2,18))) 
par(mfrow=c(1,2))
plot(g_kar,
     vertex.color = c(rep(1,16), rep(2,18)), 
     vertex.label = NA,
     main = "Fabricated Network")
plot(karate, 
     vertex.label = NA,
     main = "Real Network")
```

```{r}
par(mfrow=c(1,2))
degree_cent_fabricated <- degree(g_kar, mode = "all")
hist(degree_cent_fabricated, 
     col = "#CD7F32",
     main = "Fabricated Network")
degree_cent_real <- degree(karate, mode = "all")
hist(degree_cent_real, 
     col = "#CD7F32",
     main = "Real Network")
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
